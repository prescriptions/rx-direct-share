# rx-direct-share

Direct Share is a new feature in Android 6.0 that allows users to share content to targets, such as contacts, within other apps. It's surely a great convenience, but it also becomes annoying in some cases. So I wrote this [Greenify prescription](https://greenify.github.io/) to completely turn off the Direct Share feature on Android. Click [here](https://greenify.github.io/printempw/rx-direct-share) to import the prescription and enjoy (ROOT NEEDED).

Also, you can add an IFW rule to do the same thing: *[Removing a contact from "Direct Share" panel](https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/128053/removing-a-contact-from-direct-share-panel)*.
